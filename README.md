# Wind Energy Prediction Project (Week 3)

This project implements a comprehensive solution for wind energy prediction, covering data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning model training (XGBoost and LSTM), and an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

## Project Structure

- `eda.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the raw data.
- `feature_engineering.py`: Script to generate time-based, rolling average, and lag features from the raw data.
- `model_training.py`: Script for training and evaluating XGBoost and LSTM models for wind power prediction.
- `dashboard.py`: A Streamlit application to visualize EDA, processed features, and model predictions.
- `data.csv`: The initial dataset for the project (renamed from `processed_wind_data.csv`).
- `processed_data.csv`: The dataset after feature engineering (generated by `feature_engineering.py`).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all necessary Python dependencies.
- `xgboost_actual_vs_predicted.png`: Plot generated by `model_training.py` showing XGBoost predictions.
- `lstm_actual_vs_predicted.png`: Plot generated by `model_training.py` showing LSTM predictions.

## Setup

1.  **Ensure all project files are in your working directory.**

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the project:

1.  **Perform Feature Engineering:**

    ```bash
    python feature_engineering.py
    ```

    This script will load `data.csv`, create new features, and save the enhanced dataset as `processed_data.csv`.

2.  **Train and Evaluate Models:**

    ```bash
    python model_training.py
    ```

    This will:

    - Load `processed_data.csv`.
    - Train XGBoost and LSTM models.
    - Print evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²).
    - Generate and save plots (`xgboost_actual_vs_predicted.png`, `lstm_actual_vs_predicted.png`).

3.  **Launch the Streamlit Dashboard:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run dashboard.py
    ```

    The dashboard will open in your web browser, allowing you to:

    - Upload datasets (though `data.csv` is expected by default).
    - View EDA visualizations.
    - Examine processed features.
    - See model prediction plots and a metric comparison.
    - Filter data by date and time.

## Data Description

- **`data.csv`**: Contains initial wind data with `timestamp`, `wind_speed_ms`, `wind_direction_deg`, `actual_power_output_kw`, and `theoretical_power_curve_kwh`.
- **`processed_data.csv`**: Extends `data.csv` with engineered features such as `hour`, `weekday`, `month`, `is_weekend`, `rolling_avg_x`, and `lag_x`.

## Future Enhancements

- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Implement advanced techniques for tuning model hyperparameters.
- **Ensemble Modeling:** Combine predictions from multiple models for potentially better accuracy.
- **More Sophisticated LSTM Architectures:** Experiment with multi-layer LSTMs, bidirectional LSTMs, or attention mechanisms.
- **Feature Selection:** Explore methods to select the most impactful features for prediction.
- **Deployment to Cloud:** Integrate the dashboard and models with cloud platforms for scalable deployment.
