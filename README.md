# Wind Energy Prediction Project

This project demonstrates a basic wind energy prediction model using historical wind data.

## Project Structure

- `preprocess_data.py`: A Python script to preprocess raw wind data. It handles timestamp conversion, column renaming, and selection of relevant features.
- `predict_wind_power.py`: A Python script that loads the preprocessed data, trains a linear regression model, and predicts wind power output.
- `processed_wind_data.csv`: The cleaned and preprocessed dataset used for training and prediction.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `actual_vs_predicted_wind_power.png`: A plot generated by `predict_wind_power.py` showing the actual versus predicted wind power output.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure all project files are in your working directory.**

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Ensure you have the `processed_wind_data.csv` file in your project directory.** This file is the output of the preprocessing step and the input for the prediction model.

2.  **Run the prediction script:**

    ```bash
    python predict_wind_power.py
    ```

    This script will:
    - Load the `processed_wind_data.csv`.
    - Train a linear regression model.
    - Print model evaluation metrics (MAE, R-squared).
    - Display sample actual vs. predicted power output values.
    - Generate and save a plot named `actual_vs_predicted_wind_power.png`.

## Data Description

The `processed_wind_data.csv` file contains the following key columns:

- `timestamp`: Date and time of the measurement.
- `wind_speed_ms`: Wind speed in meters per second.
- `wind_direction_deg`: Wind direction in degrees.
- `actual_power_output_kw`: The actual measured wind turbine power output in kilowatts.
- `theoretical_power_curve_kwh`: The theoretical power output based on the wind speed and turbine's power curve in kilowatt-hours.

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Models:** Explore more sophisticated machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) for improved prediction accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create additional features from existing data (e.g., lag features, rolling averages, seasonality) to capture more complex patterns.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters for better performance.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Implement time series specific models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to leverage the temporal nature of the data.
- **External Data Integration:** Incorporate additional relevant data such as air temperature, pressure, or geographical information if available.
